# Advanced Random Map Studio
ARMS has two main goals.
- Create a more user friendly environment for making Random Maps without scripting knowledge, with built-in advanced techniques that are frequently used by RMS veterans to make more interesting, balanced and/or creative maps.
- Allow the use of text to create maps, not unlike: "Arabia with a golden hill in the center, with a winter theme. Also remove secondary and neutral Gold from each player." Should make exactly that. This is an advanced goal used in a university research project.

ARMS is being developed by abductedPlatypus with a lot of consultancy from the magnificent Chrazini.

No code is available yet. However the Wiki contains advanced tips and tricks for making RMS scripts, used as a reference for making ARMS, but freely available for any RMScripter.
